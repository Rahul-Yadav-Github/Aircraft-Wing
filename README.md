# Aircraft Wing Design in SolidWorks

This project involves designing an aircraft wing using SolidWorks. The design includes creating the airfoil profile, extruding the wing, adding structural components, and assembling the parts. The project also covers material application and optional simulations for performance analysis.

## Project Structure

- **/Designs**: Contains the SolidWorks part and assembly files.
- **/Drawings**: Includes detailed technical drawings for manufacturing.

## Requirements

- SolidWorks 2018 or later
- Basic knowledge of SolidWorks features and tools

## Steps to Design the Aircraft Wing

1. **Create the Airfoil Profile**
   - Open SolidWorks and create a new part.
   - Use the `Sketch` tool to draw the airfoil profile based on specifications.
   - Import airfoil coordinates if available and plot the points using the `Spline` tool.

2. **Extrude the Airfoil**
   - Use the `Extrude Boss/Base` feature to give the airfoil thickness.
   - Specify the wing span during the extrusion process.

3. **Add Wing Components**
   - Create wing ribs at regular intervals using the `Sketch` and `Extrude` tools.
   - Design the spars running along the length of the wing.

4. **Assemble the Wing**
   - Open a new assembly file and import the wing components.
   - Use the `Mate` feature to align and fix the components.

5. **Apply Materials and Properties**
   - Apply appropriate materials using the `Material` feature.
   - Assign properties based on the selected materials.

6. **Perform Simulations (Optional)**
   - Use `Simulation` tools to analyze structural performance.
   - Perform stress analysis, airflow simulation, and other tests.

7. **Finalize and Document**
   - Review the design and make adjustments.
   - Create detailed drawings and documentation.
